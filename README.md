# TEE Agent

## Concept

This is a tee agent running in a nitro enclave instance.
The code of the agent is signed by aws and its public key is generated randomly at start.
No one but the agent has access to the corresponding private key.

## Verify agent 

## Verify the code attestation

The attestation is signed by aws and contains the code hash. 
To verify the attestation you need the [aws root certificate](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem).

Here is a rust crate to parse and verify the attestation [tee-attestation-verifier](https://crates.io/crates/tee-attestation-verifier)


## Verify the code hash 

The code hash is a representation of the code of the agent.

To rebuild the code hash, you have to follow the steps belows to rebuild the enclave image from source, within an ec2 instance.
Then run the enclave image and measure the PCRs value.
The second PCR value correspond to the code hash of the agent that was published.

## Setup ec2 nitro instance 

You can do it with UI (recommended) or with CLI:

``` shell
aws ec2 run-instances \
--image-id ami-0b5eea76982371e91 \
--count 1 \
--instance-type m5.xlarge \
--key-name <key-name> \
--security-group-ids sg-0a006bcdd6147509f \
--tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=my-nitro-tee-1}]' \
--enclave-options 'Enabled=true'
```

If you go with the UI:
- Pick a instance good enough such as md5.xlarge, enable nitro 
- Make sure that the ports needed by your application are open by checking the security group, in "security" tab in the instance screen.

### Setup nitro cli

[see doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-cli-install.html)

``` shell
sudo /setup.sh
```


Allocate more memory for the enclave if necessary
``` shell
sudo nano /etc/nitro_enclaves/allocator.yaml

sudo systemctl restart nitro-enclaves-allocator.service

```

## Run enclave

- clone this repo in the instance 

``` shell
make
```
### Start gvproxy 

Gvproxy is a reverse proxy that allows the enclave to communicate with the outside world.

Use screen to run gvproxy in background

``` shell
screen
./gvproxy.sh
```

### Run in production mode

``` shell
sudo ./run-enclave.sh <image_eif>
```

### Test

Get current instance ip

``` shell
curl ifconfig.me
```

call config endpoint to confirm that the enclave is running

``` shell
curl http://127.0.0.1:7047/api/v1/config
```

### Measure enclave PCRS to verify code hash

``` shell
nitro-cli describe-enclaves
```

## Setup environment variables

The env variable system is similar to variables in a smart contract. 
An operator address is hardcoded before enclave initialization.
After deployment, the operator can set the environment variables using a SECP256k1 signature.
Message is (tee_name, function, var_name, new_value).
Variables can also have immutable property, and therefore be set only once.
The difference with a smart contract is that the environment variables can be set to hidden.
Hidden variables can be changed to public, but not the other way.
Similarly, mutable variables can be changed to immutable, but not the other way.


Example:

``` shell
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:7047/api/v1//variables' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "variables": [ {
    "name": "anthropic_api_key" ,
    "value": "sk-proj-f-xxxxxx",
    "signature": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}]
}
'
```

## Prompting Chat Agent

All responses are signed using the TEE Agent key.

```
        result = {}
        result["model"] = model
        result["response"] = prompt_openrouter(model, system_prompt, messages, tools, tool_choice)
        result["messages"] = messages
        result["tools"] = tools
        result["system_prompt"] = system_prompt
        result["signature"] = sign_ethereum_message(str(result), private_key.to_string().hex())  
```

Query endpoint 

```
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:7047/api/v1/prompt' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful AI assistant focused on technical writing and documentation.",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "give me the weather in paris"
        }
    ],
    "tools": [
        {
            "type": "function",
            "function": {

                        },
                        "unit": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "enum": [
                                "celsius",
                                "fahrenheit"
                            ]
                        }
                    },
                    "required": [
                        "location"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```
